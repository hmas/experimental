The function count_palindromic_substrings(s) counts the number of palindromic substrings in a given string s. It uses a helper function expand_around_center to expand around each character (and each pair of characters) in the string to check for palindromes. The main function iterates over each character in the string, treating it as the center of a potential palindrome, and calls the helper function to count palindromes of both odd and even lengths. The unit tests cover various cases including single characters, no palindromes, all same characters, and mixed characters. The stress test checks the performance of the function with a long string of repeated characters.
